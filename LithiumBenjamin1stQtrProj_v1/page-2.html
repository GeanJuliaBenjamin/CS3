    <h3 class="text-box1"> Shading is the the darkening or coloring of an illustration or diagram with parallel lines or a block of color. We must remember that when the subject is farther from the light source, the shadows must have an airbrush effect. Whilst, when the subject is closer to the light source, the shadows are harsher and the lines are cleaner, as opposed to the farther light source which will not directly hit the subject so the lines are more blurred. </h3>

    <h3 class="text-box2"> Color theory is how the hues and values effect how a color is percepted by ones eyes. For example, when we put a dark background on a subject whose color value is lighter than that of the background, it appears lighter. We must choose colors wisely when dealing with our artworks as sometimes too much color can make the drawing hard on the eyes and too little color may make the drawing look bland and dead. </h3>

    <h3 class="image-box3"><img src="images/anatomy.png" width="400" height="250"></h3> 
    <h3 class="text-box3"> The human anatomy is always fluid, we can make poses by just using one swift line. I recommend to use references when we have trouble making a pose as this can further let us improve the observation and construction of human bodies. We must keep in mind that we need to pay attention to the skeletal system of the human anatomy to be able to construct a proper pose, we also need to observe how muscles wrap around the bones and give structure and shape to the human body. </h3>
